# Password-Reminder

Password reminder is a program full made by java and swing library which store your accounts on your local computer, so connection with network is
not required. Data is stored your account's maps which are saved in .ser files. Account's files are packed in hidden folders in your computer's storage.
In addition, all your accounts are encrypted by Caesar Cipher with 5 different keys
intended to cipher various information like service name, login name etc.
Program has a lot of various security against errors. I will be grateful with the feedback or contact.
